## Sustainable spillovers: health and environmental impacts of solar energy adoption 

### Project overview

Rapid urbanization is straining electricity grids in many developing countries. Nigeria boasts high connectivity rates, but actual electricity access is much lowerâ€”the average electricity connection only functions a third of the time. Many households rely on generators to fill this service gap. These small generators are often powered by two-stroke gasoline engines, which generate carbon emissions and harmful co-pollutants. Solar home systems are an increasingly affordable alternative energy source. We partner with a growing solar company in Nigeria to test if households with solar system access substitute away from generators. We additionally propose to pilot low-cost sensors to directly measure carbon and co-pollutant generator emissions. Imported fuel quality in Nigeria is notoriously low, which likely increases emissions. Our pilot and measurement activities will inform the development of a full-scale randomized evaluation to quantify the carbon and air quality benefits of household substitution from generators to solar power.
