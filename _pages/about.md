I joined the Centre for Development Economics and Sustainability (CDES) as a Senior Research Fellow in 2022. Previously, I've held academic positions at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (joint appointment between the [Robert M. La Follette School of Public Affairs](https://lafollette.wisc.edu/) and the [Agricultural and Applied Economics](https://aae.wisc.edu/) department) and the [School of Economics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/schools/school-of-economics.html) at the University of Sydney. 

My research draws on insights from behavioral economics and employs econometrics, field-, and lab-in-the-field experiments to examine a variety of topics within development economics. I also think a lot about heterogeneity: how it shapes the success and optimal design of public policy, and how heterogeneous returns affect individual decision-making.

In recent interdisciplinary work, I collaborate with atmospheric scientists to improve access to and analysis of air quality data in sub-Saharan Africa. Towards this goal, I co-founded [AfriqAir](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/afriqair/), a cross-continental research network that has to date deployed over 50 low-cost sensors and reference-grade monitors in 11 African countries.
